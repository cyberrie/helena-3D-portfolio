# Helena's 3D Portfolio

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to solidify my React skills and also learn Three.js and Framer Motion. I was inspired to create a 3D portfolio website after seeing impressive portfolio websites like [Bruno Simon's](https://bruno-simon.com/), and I was intrigued by how to incorporate 3D art into a website.

Through this project, I wanted to challenge myself to create a visually engaging website that showcases my skills as a frontend developer while also learning new technologies. By building and rebuilding the website from scratch, I was able to solidify my knowledge of React and learn how to use Three.js to create 3D art and Framer Motion to add animations to my components.
